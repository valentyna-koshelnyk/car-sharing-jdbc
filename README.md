# car-sharing-jdbc

During the project implementation, I learned the basics of SQL and worked with the H2 database. It's a very simple project showing ability to handle queries using JDBC and basic CRUD operations making use of DAO pattern. The basic IO operations (Scanner for user input) was a requirement to pass the tests on Hyperskill and move on another stage.
